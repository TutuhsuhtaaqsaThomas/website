  <p>My Greatest Accomplishment
<p>By Tutuhsuhtaaqsa Thomas

<p>It was April 30, 1995 at 8 am on an early Sunday morning. I had organized for a group of our Adult Basic Education (ABE) class to participate in this year’s Garden City 10 k run. I do not even recall the group name we registered under.

<p>My mother and daughter were supposed to come and watch me, support me that day. But they both slept in, so I just ended up catching the bus downtown by myself that day.

<p>The run started approximately at Yates Street and Cook Street. There was over 2000 participants in this run.

<p>I started to walk with this friend of mine. My back was aching that morning, as though I stretched a muscle in my back. Anyways, my friend and I were just walking and talking. It was an absolutely beautiful morning that day.

<p>Not too long after we started walking, my friend said to me, “Okay well I’m gonna start running, catch ya later!” And I thought to myself, “Well I’m not going to walk this whole thing, by myself. So, I said a quick prayer to myself, “Dear God, please take care of my back, thank you.”

<p>And then I started to trot.

<p>I would keep telling myself, “Just keep your legs moving”

<p>“You’re doing a great job!”

<p>“Thank you, God, for giving me the ability to do this, run, my legs, and so on”


<p>5 Km Mark

<p>There were people on the sides of the streets cheering for people. Before you know it, I am at the 5-k mark. I thought to myself, “Wow, I give myself permission to stop anytime after this!” I did not train for this. I mean I did jog, but no more than a mile or two usually.

<p>Coming down Cook street and heading towards Dallas Road was breathtaking, as you could see Olympic National Park. Someone gave me a small cup of water. I took sips because I was jogging and breathing heavily at this point.

<p>7 Km Mark

<p>I was amazed when I passed the 7-k mark. Again, I gave myself permission to stop anytime now. By now I’m along Dallas Road and there are yet more people clapping to runners, telling them “You’re at the 7-k mark, only 3 more kms to go!”

<p>2 Km to Go!

<p>I kept thinking to myself if I make it to 8, I’ll see if I feel like stopping, then I will. I made it to 8 k and the volunteers kept saying, “Only 2 more kms to go! You can do it!”

<p>9 Km Mark

<p>Now I’m by the Breakwater and approaching the 9-k mark. I am barely moving. I mean old people were passing me. People who were speed walking were passing me.

<p>I told myself, I don’t care if they are passing me. I’m not trained for this. Just keep your legs moving I’d tell myself. Your doing a great job Tracey! You can stop anytime now!

<p>At one point I had to acknowledge to my body that I had a cramp in my tummy. And then I said to myself, “I am not going to focus on you.” I took a deep breath and let it out slowly.

<p>Final Stretch

<p>Before you know it, I am in the final stretch. I had this overwhelming sense of euphoria come over me, in my chest, in my mind. I passed the finish line.

<p>I don’t even recall what street we finished on. I think we were by the Legislature buildings because I recall walking for a bit to keep myself from stiffing up and I was walking on grass. I vaguely recall a statue of some sort. My legs felt like rubber once I finished.

<p>I wanted to celebrate. So, of all idiotic things, I lit up a cigarette that I no doubt bummed from someone on the street. I felt a huge sense of accomplishment, only there was no one there to congratulate me or tell me I done a great job!

<p>Conclusion

<p>I recall for the next two days being really sore and tired and having to soak my legs in the tub. That was the last time I ever went jogging again. I always remember this as one of my greatest accomplishments in life because it shows my determination. I encouraged myself. I thanked the Creator the whole time I was running.
